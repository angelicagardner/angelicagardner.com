## Goals
* **Who am I** - working hours (I prefer to *work from home*, but love group discussions where coworkers share their thoughts and experiences. My ideal work week is when I can work from home with 1-2 days visiting the office or a coworking space for updates and project discussions.
* **Location** - I am currently based in beautiful *Stockholm, Sweden*. Previously, I've lived in Kampala, Uganda and Mecca, Saudi Arabia. I'm always up for traveling and exploring new locations - however, in most cases, I'm not open to relocate for a job. 
* **Contact** - I am avaliable via Twitter at all times during my local working hours. I'm reachable via e-mail where I respond quickly to urgent requests, and as for normal and non-urgent requests I try my best to respond to all queries, although sometimes I might not be able to.
* **About me** - I do not speak at conferences or meetups that does not have a Code of Conduct. 
* **Career timeline** - and a post about my background story.
* **Blog**
