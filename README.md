## Goals
* **Who am I** - working hours (I prefer to *work from home*, but love group discussions where coworkers share their thoughts and experiences. My ideal work week is when I can work from home with 1-2 days visiting the office or a coworking space for updates and project discussions.
* **Location** - I am currently based in beautiful *Stockholm, Sweden*. Previously, I've lived in Kampala, Uganda and Mecca, Saudi Arabia. I'm always up for traveling and exploring new locations - however, in most cases, I'm not open to relocate for a job. 
* **Contact** - I am avaliable via Twitter at all times during my local working hours. I'm reachable via e-mail where I respond quickly to urgent requests, and as for normal and non-urgent requests I try my best to respond to all queries, although sometimes I might not be able to.
* **About me** - some personal facts? Or just describing my personality. I'm a positive person to the core, always eager to learn and improve. Be kind, have empathy, respect differings. Everything is about collaboration and caring. Choose growth opportunities to learn, to grow new skills. I'm a curious human, passionate about science always asking questions, formulating hypothesis, and running experiments. I am a ... student but that does not say anything special about me. I don't believe in acronyms, I believe in people. I have met many brilliant people without a degree, and many people of various degrees without creativity, empathy, or work ethic. I love the thought to give without expecting a return. Every single one of us meet people everyday, some of them we'll help, support, influence, and encourage without even thinking about it. Those influences might change lives.
* **About me professionally** - Programming stacks I master and other experience I have. When it comes to team work I value trust and respect. I believe that diversity of views and perspectives sets the boundaries forward and makes it possile to consider different angles. Please note that all professional agreements will need to adhere to rules of inclusion. I do not speak at conferences or meetups that does not have a Code of Conduct. I have a great respect for good documentation, that's why I take an extra step by the level of care and effort for each article, tutorial, quickstart, reviews, etc before it's published to production. It's a commitment to empathy and respect; welcoming people at whatever level they are at. In my opinion, documentation is of great support for a developer. I try to make it awesome.
* **Career timeline** - With a post about my background story.
* **Blog** - Transfer posts from old WP blog.
